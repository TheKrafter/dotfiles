# dotfiles
## My dotfiles.

![My Wallpaper](Pictures/wallpaper.jpg)
also, see [my r/unixporn post](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/wqtn0b/i3_my_first_rice_still_a_few_kinks_to_work_out/) 

Scripts are in `.config/scripts`
yeah.
idk what else to say, these are my dotfiles for my laptop, used on the i3wm Fedora spin, i use it for school and most of my productivity. My desktop still runs Fedora + GNOME which I love. atm im just trying out tiling window managers.

Everything is placed in relation to $HOME. My wallpaper is at `Pictures/wallpaper.jpg`, which is where my i3wm config looks for it.

I also use FontAwesome for icons and such in i3blocks.

### ./sync.sh
is a simple script to copy config files to/from a set directory intended for syncing with this repo.
